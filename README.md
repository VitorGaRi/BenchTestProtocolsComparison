# Comparative analysis of communication protocols and their impact on brushless motor response and drone control
Here you will find all the necessary information to configure a STM32 based flight controller for changing ESC communication protocols: Standard PWM and OneShot125 (other protocols are planned for future work) and running a stabilization routine aiming at comparing the protocol's response.
For any clarifications, feel free to contact me by email at v.ribeiro@usp.br or professor Carmona at andre.hernandes@ufscar.br.
